# Berlin Apartment Rent Estimator (V3.0)
As an architect transitioning into data science, I developed this end-to-end Machine Learning project to decode the complex Berlin rental market. Unlike standard tutorials, this project leverages domain knowledge to perform deep feature engineering—quantifying the real value of "Altbau" (pre-1935 buildings), specific "Kiez" (neighborhood) premiums, and amenities like fitted kitchens.
## Key Features:
Data Pipeline: Cleaned and processed 10,000+ raw listings from Immoscout24 using Pandas.
Machine Learning: Built and optimized a Linear Regression model with Scikit-Learn, achieving an R² score of 84.06% and an MAE of ±220€.
Interactive UI: Developed a user-friendly calculator using ipywidgets for real-time rent estimation.
Market Insight: Revealed that location (micro-district) and building type (Altbau vs. Plattenbau) outweigh simple floor area in pricing.
